## Simple Shell Program

# About
This program is an introduction for me to systems programming, while I have taken a course in systems programming in which various topics were covered in the C programming language this is an opportunity for me to take what I have learned and implement it into a deliverable outside the classroom setting.

To accomplish this I will be a developing my very own shell program in the C programming language.

A basic shell will need three parts:

1. Parser
2. Executor
3. Shell subsystem

The goal of this project is to implement these three simple parts to create a functional shell and from there to customize and enchance the shell to my liking. Perhaps some feature extensions can be made, further research and tinkering will lead to some ideas and changes I am sure.
