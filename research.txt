The workflow that needs to be implemented for a shell to start new processes is the fork, exec, wait cycle.
This basically allows a new process to be spawned, execute whatever command it needs to, and the parent process waits for the child to finish executing to avoid zombie processes.
There are addional shell features beyond the basics that will be useful to implement as well such as:
1. Input/output redirection
2. Piping
3. command history
4. Wildcards
5. Background processes/job control

For now implementing the basics is a good enough start but eventually programming some of the more advanced shell features is a good idea not just as a learning exercise but also to make the shell more useful.
